# VS Code AVR MCU Development Project Template

This template repository can be used to create a new Github project with all the files and folders that are usefull for AVR MCU embedded systems firmware development as well as a `hardware` directory where KiCAD project files are placed and a `mechanical` folder where (3D) housing and other mechanical information for the project can be stored.

To create the KiCAD folder structure and templates, another template is used that is stored in de user template directory of KiCAD. This template is uswed to create a new KiCAD project in the `hardware` folder. Make sure to uncheck the 'create project directiry' option to make sure it is installed in  teh root of the `hardware` folder.
